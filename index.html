					<h2>1965 Oldsmobile Cutlass F-85 Convertible</h2>
					<p>This was my first car, and the color was turquoise with a black top. It had automatic 2 speed transmission which means I didn't have to worry about shifting gears manually. The small v8 engine was not fast but it was plenty for my first car. It had buckets seats with only lap seat belts not like today's vehicle which have to have should and lap combination seat belts.</p>

					<h2>1987 Chevrolet Monte Carlo Super Sport (SS)</h2>
					<p>This was my first car I bought with my own money. I love this car to this day, and it was really fun to drive. I selected the standard SS model rather than the Aero-coupe model because it wasn’t my style. Aero-coupe models had an extended rear window that protruded more towards the back of the car. The car's interior and exterior color was burgundy which had an automatic transmission with a V8 engine.</p>

					<h2>1967 Chevrolet Camaro in Candy Apple Red paint</h2>
					<p>This was my first project car that I should not have bought. It was fast and dangerous. As a teenager, I was cocky and was considered a “race face”. With this car, I got into my first accident. I totaled it after only having it for less than a year and was never able to afford to rebuild it to drive on the street again. It had a hot rod V8 engine with an automatic transmission and a candy apple red paint job with too many pinstripes. It was loud whenever I stomped on the gas pedal, and it went too fast down the road leaving costly tire marks behind. It was a blast to drive but more trouble than it was worth after I came to my senses.</p>

					<h2>1968 Ford Mustang</h2>
					<p>I bought this beautiful blue coupe for my fiancé’ in 1989 from northern Minnesota. After having a great time with the car several years, we had to sell it. The Mustang was starting to get rusting and once the rust sets in these old cars you must spend time and money to stop it from spreading. My wife enjoyed that car very much as I enjoyed having it around. Her and I had a race with her Mustang against my new Monte Carlo SS once and guess who won? Yep, she did. I didn’t mind because it was a blast.</p>

					<h2>1989 Ford Taurus Station wagon</h2>
					<p>This was the second new car I bought. It was a big change from the sports cars I had but I had to change my attitude and get away from the costly fun cars for the time being. I traded in my Monte Carlo SS for this Taurus because of future plans. It was a reliable car and we put over 100,000 miles on it and drove it back and forth to Minnesota from St. Louis, MO. </p>

					<h2>1997 Honda Accord sedan</h2>
					<p>This was a nice reliable transportation for me to use for work. I bought it with over  100,000 miles on it and drove it for years until the engine blown out with over 450,000 miles. I did a lot of mechanical work on it myself for years and was able to keep it running for cheap.</p>

					<h2>2004 Ford F-150</h2>
					<p>At the time we bought this truck, we planned on purchasing a travel trailer (RV) sometime in the furture. Even though the truck is the RV's transporter, my wife drives the truck as her main transportation. It consumes alot of gas but it hauls the RV well and is pretty reliable.  </p>
					<p>We go camping during the summer in our 19-foot trailer and the truck hauls it to the camp ground with no problems.<a href="https://cdn05.carsforsale.com/337c4612e6880d50769339249a64928e/800x600/2004-ford-f-150-xlt-4dr-supercab-rwd-styleside-5-5-ft-sb.jpg">uuuuuuuuuuuuu</a>jjjjjjjjjjj.</p>

					<h2>1999 Honda Civic 4 door</h2>
					<p>I got this black automatic transmission car for our younger kids to use for transportation. They’ve used it well and it has been generally reliable. Purchase it for $1200.00 with 255,000 miles on it in 2015. Since I know Honda cars pretty well, I had a good idea of what to look for in these used cars and know a decent one when I see one. We still have the car today and it has about 290,000 miles on it.</p>

					<h2>2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse GT</h2>
					<p>This white Eclipse was recently giving too me and it’s a fun car to drive. Albeit it needs a turbocharger to go faster to make me happier. It rides close to the ground and drives a little rough, but it is very nimble around corners. This is as close to a sports car I’ve gotten since my Camaro and the Monte Carlo SS so I’m going to enjoy as much as I can.</p>

						<h2>2004 Lexus GS350</h2>
						<testP class="funParagraph">This may very well be the beast I hope to build in the near future after I work as a developer for several years. I would modify the engine internally to withstand the higher compression stresses of a turbocharged setup. This will be my "mid-life" crises drifting hot rod adrenalin rush jalopy. I hope to get around 800 horsepower to the engine and get close to 10 seconds in a quarter mile drag strip run. If you see me in this car and I am spinning my rear tires on purpose, you will definitely see a big smile on my face and laughing like a mad man!</testP>
