					<h2>1965 Oldsmobile F-85 Cutlass Convertible</h2>
					<p>This was my first car, and the color was turquoise with a black top. It had automatic 2 speed transmission which means I didn't have to worry about shifting gears manually. The small v8 engine was not fast but it was plenty for my first car. It had buckets seats with only lap seat belts not like today's vehicle which have to have should and lap combination seat belts.</p>

					<h2>1987 Chevrolet Monte Carlo Super Sport (SS)</h2>
					<p>This is my first car I bought with my own money. I love this car to this day, and it was a really fun to drive. I selected the standard SS modal rather than the Aero-coupe model because it wasn’t my style. Aero-coupe model had an extended rear window that protruded more towards the back of the car. The car interior and exterior color was burgundy. It had an automatic transmission with a V8 engine</p>

					<h2>1967 Chevrolet Camaro</h2>
					<p>This was my first project car that I should not have bought. It was fast and dangerous. As a teenager, I was cocky and was considered a “race face”. With this car, I got into my first accident. I totaled it after only having it for less than a year and was never able to afford to rebuild it to drive on the street again. It had a hot rod V8 engine with an automatic transmission and a candy apple red paint job with too many pinstripes. It was loud whenever I stomped on the gas pedal, and it went too fast down the road leaving costly tire marks behind. It was a blast to drive but more trouble than it was worth after I came to my senses.</p>
